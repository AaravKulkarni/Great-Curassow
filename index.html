        <h3>
            The great curassow (Crax rubra) is a large,
             pheasant-like bird from the Neotropical rainforests, its range extending 
             from eastern Mexico, through Central America to western Colombia and northwestern 
             Ecuador. Male birds are black with curly crests and yellow beaks; females come 
             in three colour morphs, barred, rufous and black. These birds form small groups,
              foraging mainly on the ground for fruits and arthropods, and the occasional small 
              vertebrate, but they roost and nest in trees. This species is monogamous, the male
               usually building the rather small nest of leaves in which two eggs are laid. This
                species is threatened by loss of habitat and hunting, and the International Union 
                for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as "vulnerable".
